      <h2>Elicitation – Accessing the Inside &amp; Outside View</h2>
      <p>
        We start by clarifying your goals—defining measurable outcomes and resolution criteria. But it’s more than that:
        we unlock insights from every level of your organisation. And we give you access to the outside view.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How it works:</strong> Imagine you are the CEO in a boardroom, confronted with a critical decision. While usually information is filtered at every level (high latency, low resolution, by the time it reaches you), and the diversity of advice you receive is limited by the nunmber of board room chairs, with Cassi an unexpected insight can come from anywhere within the organisation, free of bias, from all levels, faster - perhaps revealing a hidden opportunity or risk. This is the power of elciting a more complete inside view. Even before we seek and objectively score the factors idenitified across your organisation, in our experience, the act of elcitation from the C-Suite drives much greater rigour than decisiions and plans might otherwise recieve. Cassi elicits clearly what you as CEO and your C-Suite want to achieve - your desired outcome. Cassi helps you clearly set out your resolution criteria: how would you know if you had succeeded? Cassi elicits from you the most important factors for your success. By time you turn to the rest of your staff for the inside view, Cassi has already improved your decision-making. This is the power of elicitation. 
      </p>
        Then we let you turn to the outside view - which the late Daniel Kahneman, eminent psychologist and author of 'Thinking Fast and Slow' has showed was crucial to debiasing decisions. Cassi does this by enabling you to run competitions or select the diversity you lack internally, cognitive, national, professional, whatever it may be, and have them generate factors that might influence your decision. In doing so we ensure you have the maximum diversity of perspective on your problem, help further reduce biases from HIPPOs (Highest Paid Persons Opinion), confirmatiion bias, the risk that maybe your organisation has become an echo chamber. The outside view helps you reduce risks, spot opportunities, and ensure you have principled way of demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that you are doing all you can to ensure you are asking yourself the right questions at all stages of the planning process.
